    "In Thailand, there is expotentially growing demand for coffee drinks in recent years. According to Euromonitor, the coffee consumption in Thailand ranked 41th out of all countries. In addition, the average age of coffee consumers in Thailand edged down to 16-18 years old from 23 years old in the past years. These numbers confirm that there is still high demand for coffee and coffee shop business is still a highly profitable business in Thailand these days."
